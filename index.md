# My Data Science and Projects Portfolio

So excited about finishing a structured 99 day learning path for a Data Scientist from [SuperDataScience](https://www.superdatascience.com/paths)! Most of the things here are the result of me recording and creating useful templates while going through that learning path.

## My Machine Learning Toolkit and Templates

My [ml toolkit](https://github.com/mirokuru/ml_toolkit) has a data preprocessing template, a general toolkit, and templates for regression, classification, and clustering. There are also templates for deep learning, natural language processing, model selection, dimensionality reduction, and boosting.

## Predicting Car Prices

In this [case study](https://github.com/mirokuru/predicting_car_prices) the goal was to try to predict car prices using an IML dataset. The task required extensive data wrangling. In addition to Linear Regression I also tested if XGBoost would help here and it sure did.

## Investigating a drop in user engagement

A workshop on [Mode.com](https://mode.com). The project involved making
hypotheses for the cause of a drop in user engagement, evaluating them, planning
how to test them, and deciding on which is the best order to test them out. The
investigation was done through SQL queries which were plotted in Mode. A
[report with the process and the SQL queries](/reports/drop-in-user-engagement.pdf)
can be downloaded here.

## learning-seaborn
A learning project from SuperDataScience's Python A-Z course for learning Python for data science. The project involves [reproducing a data visualization based on an image using Python](https://github.com/mirokuru/learning-seaborn).

The code involves:

- reading a csv file where you first need to find out the encoding used
- filtering the data with multiple values from different fields
- using Seaborn to overlay two plots over each other: a boxplot and a stripplot
- configuring chart style, colors, labels, etc

*Stay tuned for some new projects!*

# Older projects

Just some older projects related to data and visualization

## Chart tool for snow and ground frost timelines

I created this using FlotChart when working at the Finnish Environment Institute. The tool could be used to create charts for a specified time range with multiple settings and visualizations options. The chart could then be saved as an image.

## Road risk information system

I created also this while working at the Finnish Environment Institute. The service could be used by environmental specialists to assess and monitor risks road salting induces to water intake areas.
