## My Data Science and Projects Portfolio

I'm following a structured 99 day learning path for a Data Scientist from [SuperDataScience](https://www.superdatascience.com/paths).

For now this space has been initialized for upcoming projects ;)

*Stay tuned!*

# Some older projects

## Chart tool for snow and ground frost timelines

I created this using FlotChart when working at the Finnish Environment Institute. The tool could be used to create charts for a specified time range with multiple settings and visualizations options. The chart could then be saved as an image.

## Road risk information system

I created also this while working at the Finnish Environment Institute. The service could be used by environmental specialists to assess and monitor risks road salting induces to water intake areas.
